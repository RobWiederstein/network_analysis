## Defined

"A network is not just a metaphor: it is a precise, mathematical construct of nodes (vertices, actors) N and edges (ties, relations) E that can be directed or undirected." [@jasneyIntroductionSocialNetwork2018]

## Input formats

Building a network graph is confusing because of the number of potential input types. Users must first distinguish whether the input is an adjacency matrix, incidence matrix, or edge list.

## R packages

Three `R` packages are dedicated to network analysis and are available for download from CRAN:  `igraph`, `ggraph`, and `networkD3`.


You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].
