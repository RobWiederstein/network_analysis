We can include information (attributes) on the nodes as well as the edges.” (Jasney 2018) Figure 1.1: A network consisting of nodes, N, and directed edges E. 1.2 Input formats Building a network graph is challenging because of the number of potential input types. Users must first distinguish whether the input is an adjacency matrix, incidence matrix, or edge list. Then, the user must know if the graph is directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted. (Holtz 2020) 1.2.1 Adjacency matrix An adjacency matrix is a square matrix where the number of rows and columns are the same. igraph can read an adjacency matrix using the graph_from_adjacency_matrix() function. Figure 1.2: Nodes with adjacency matrix. (Jasney 2018) 1.2.2 Incidence matrix The rows and colunms of an incidence matrix do not have to be equal. Its shape can be rectangular in addition to square. igraph can read an incidence matrix using the graph_from_incidence_matrix(). a b c d e A 0 2 0 2 0 B 2 1 0 0 1 C 0 1 1 2 0 D 1 2 1 0 0 E 0 2 1 0 1 F 2 0 1 0 1 Figure 1.3: Plot generated from incidency matrix. 1.2.3 Edge list An edge list has 2 columns. Each observation represents a connection between two things. The two column names are alternatively named (1) an origin and a destination or (2)a source and target, depending on the package used. The column names are often the key to a successful importation of the data. igraph imports an edge list graph_from_data_frame() function. Figure 1.4: Nodes with edge list. (Jasney 2018) 1.2.4 Dataframe distinguished 1.3 R packages Three R packages are dedicated to network analysis and are available for download from CRAN: igraph, ggraph, and networkD3. You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2020) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (???). References "]]
