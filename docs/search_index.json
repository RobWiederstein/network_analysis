It can handle large graphs very well and provides functions for generating random and regular graphs, graph visualization, centrality methods and much more. ggraph 38914 The grammar of graphics as implemented in ggplot2 is a poor fit for graph and network visualizations due to its reliance on tabular data input. ggraph is an extension of the ggplot2 API tailored to graph visualizations and provides the same flexible approach to building up plots layer by layer. graphlayouts 32993 Several new layout algorithms to visualize networks are provided which are not part of ‘igraph’. Most are based on the concept of stress majorization by Gansner et al. (2004) &lt;doi:10.1007/978-3-540-31843-9_25&gt;;. Some more specific algorithms allow to emphasize hidden group structures in networks or focus on specific nodes. visNetwork 32943 Provides an R interface to the ‘vis.js’ JavaScript charting library. It allows an interactive visualization of networks. sna 22029 A range of tools for social network analysis, including node and graph-level indices, structural distance and covariance methods, structural equivalence detection, network regression, random graph generation, and 2D/3D network visualization. DiagrammeR 20429 Build graph/network structures using functions for stepwise addition and deletion of nodes and edges. Work with data available in tables for bulk addition of nodes, edges, and associated metadata. Use graph selections and traversals to apply changes to specific nodes or edges. A wide selection of graph algorithms allow for the analysis of graphs. Visualize the graphs and take advantage of any aesthetic properties assigned to nodes and edges. influenceR 16695 Provides functionality to compute various node centrality measures on networks. Included are functions to compute betweenness centrality (by utilizing Madduri and Bader’s SNAP library), implementations of Burt’s constraint and effective network size (ENS) metrics, Borgatti’s algorithm to identify key players, and Valente’s bridging metric. On Unix systems, the betweenness, Key Players, and bridging implementations are parallelized with OpenMP, which may run faster on systems which have OpenMP configured. threejs 12920 Create interactive 3D scatter plots, network plots, and globes using the ‘three.js’ visualization library (&lt;https://threejs.org&gt;;). networkD3 11508 Creates ‘D3’ ‘JavaScript’ network, tree, dendrogram, and Sankey graphs from ‘R’. d3Network 8427 This packages is intended to make it easy to create D3 JavaScript network, tree, dendrogram, and Sankey graphs from R using data frames. !!! NOTE: Active development has moved to the networkD3 package. !!! "]]
