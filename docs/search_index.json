We can include information (attributes) on the nodes as well as the edges.” (Jasney 2018) Figure 1.1: A network consisting of nodes, N, and directed edges E. 1.2 Input formats Building a network graph is challenging because of the number of potential input types. Users must first distinguish whether the input is an adjacency matrix, incidence matrix, or edge list. Then, the user must know if the graph is directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted. (Holtz 2020) 1.2.1 Adjacency matrix An adjacency matrix is a square matrix where the number of rows and columns are the same. igraph can read an adjacency matrix using the graph_from_adjacency_matrix() function. Table 1.1: Adjacency Matrix. A ‘0’ denotes no connection. A B C D E F A 0 1 0 0 0 0 B 0 0 0 0 0 0 C 0 0 0 1 0 0 D 1 0 0 0 0 0 E 0 0 0 0 2 2 F 2 0 1 0 0 0 Figure 1.2: Network plot from adjacency matrix 1.2.2 Sparse matrix The function, graph_from_adjacency_matrix(), also accepts a sparse matrix which is sometimes preferred to minimize file sizes and conserve system resources on large datasets. ## 5 x 5 sparse Matrix of class &quot;dgCMatrix&quot; ## ## [1,] . . 1 1 1 ## [2,] 1 1 1 . . ## [3,] 1 . . . 1 ## [4,] 1 1 1 . . ## [5,] 1 . 1 . 1 Figure 1.3: Network plot from sparse matrix. 1.2.3 Incidence matrix The rows and colunms of an incidence matrix do not have to be equal. Its shape can be rectangular in addition to square. igraph can read an incidence matrix using the graph_from_incidence_matrix(). Table 1.2: Example incidency matrix. a b c d e A 0 2 0 2 0 B 2 1 0 0 1 C 0 1 1 2 0 D 1 2 1 0 0 E 0 2 1 0 1 F 2 0 1 0 1 Figure 1.4: Network plot from incidency matrix. 1.2.4 Edge list An edge list has 2 columns. Each observation represents a connection between two things. The two column names are alternatively named (1) an origin and a destination or (2)a source and target, depending on the package used. The column names are often the key to a successful importation of the data. igraph imports an edge list graph_from_edgelist() function. Table 1.3: Example Edgelist. origin destination A C D A A E B E E B C F F F B B C A Figure 1.5: Plot generated from edgelist. 1.2.5 Dataframe distinguished “A data frame may for many purposes be regarded as a matrix with columns possibly of differing modes and attributes.” (R Core Team 2020) In other words, a matrix must contain all of the same data type while a dataframe can have columns with differing data types – numeric, character, factor, etc. Different authors and packages require one or the other and many coerce to the required data type internally without notification to the user. Matrices may offer greater computational efficiency although it may depend on the data types included. (find cite) 1.3 Datasets igraphdata contains a number of datasets that illustrate the use of network analysis. The command data(package=&quot;igraphdata&quot;) lists the datasets available. After loading the package, data(&quot;karate&quot;) will load, for example, the “karate” dataset. Table 1.4: Datasets included in igraphdata package.

It’s probably a safe presumption that a dataset resident within a package is formatted correctly. However, it may be helpful to check user-built data structures in a program like Gephi or Cytoscope.
