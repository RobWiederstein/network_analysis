# Preface {-}



## Why Read this Book

Network analysis can be an important strategy for understanding the direction and strength of connections between people, places and ideas. Visual representation of networks can speed the discovery process in working with data. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this book is to speed the conversion of a traditional dataframe to a network diagram with nodes and vertices. Some discusson of basic computations will be included, but formulas are omitted unless necessary for understanding.  Again, the emphasis is on producing insightful graphs of networks whose data was originally stored in a dataframe. Network analysis is not hard, but it relies on different data structures.

## Collection

What follows is admittedly not the most original or insightful work on networks.  It is an attempt to collect tutorials from disparate packages, software and websites in a single place. Attribution will be given where known.

## Assumptions

A working knowledge of `R` is necessary including how to obtain and load packages and how to manipulate basic data structures like lists and dataframes.  Methods and packages in the `tidyverse` are given priority.
