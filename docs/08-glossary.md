**Attributes** are a characteristic of the node or edge that is often designated by color, size, or shape of the object. For example, a dashed line for an edge or a blue circle for a node.

**Nodes** are also actors or vertices.  They are things like people, places, ideas that have some connection.  In mathmatical formulas, they often take the variable $N$.

**Degree** the number of nodes adjacent to the node under evaluation or the number of lines incident to it.

**Diameter** is the maximum number of edges.

**Edges** are ties, relations or connections between nodes.  Edges are often designated as $E$.

**Indegree** is the number of received ties.

**Networks**

**Network objects** is a class of objects in R designed specifically for network analysis.  They store an adjacency matrix or an edgelist as well as metadata. 

**Outdegree** the number of sent ties.

**Directed** networks
