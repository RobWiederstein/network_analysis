# Background

This is a tutorial on network analysis and visualization. Or more accurately, it is a collection of others' tutorials.

To start, the tutorial will rely on "[Gephi](https://gephi.org)," an open-source, visualization and exploration software for all kinds of graphs and networks. The lastest version .092 was released in September, 2017, and it allows for spreadsheets to be imported. Install Gephi. Gephi hosts a [repository](https://github.com/gephi/gephi) on github and an informative [wiki](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki).

# Recommended tutorials

The first tutorial is an introduction to gephi and uses LesMiserables sample dataset. The dataset is the coappearance weighted network of characters in the novel Les Miserables. D. E. Knuth, The Stanford GraphBase: A Platform for Combinatorial Computing, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA (1993). Quick start [guide](https://gephi.org/users/quick-start/).  An updated video of the tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=371n3Ye9vVo&feature=youtu.be), if you have problems.
