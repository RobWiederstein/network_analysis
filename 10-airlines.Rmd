# Case Study -- Airlines {#airlines}

There were several examples dealing with airlines. 

Flowing data has a [tutorial](https://flowingdata.com/2011/05/05/where-do-major-airlines-fly-in-the-united-states/) where Yau cleaned a dataset. The article's title is "Geographic breakdown: Where do major airlines fly?".

A second dataset is from Gephi and is contained in `data/gephy/airlines.graphml.zip`.

Yet a third is a script where I downloaded airline data from Bureau of Transportation Statistics. I opened a separate project in my r-projects directory.  It can be found at `~/Dropbox/coding/rproj/airlines`.
